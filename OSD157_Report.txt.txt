2. METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Data Processing and Pre-processing
Raw intensity files (.txt) from the Agilent platform were processed using the 
'limma' package in the R environment. Due to annotation failures in the native 
.adf files, gene identifiers were extracted directly from the raw data objects. 
Strict quality control filters were applied to remove technical control probes 
(e.g., "DarkCorner", "GE_BrightCorner") and probes lacking valid gene 
annotation.

Background correction was performed using the 'normexp' method with an offset 
of 50 to stabilize variance at low intensities. Inter-array normalization was 
conducted using the Quantile Normalization method, ensuring statistical 
comparability across all samples. Duplicate probes mapping to the same gene 
were collapsed by averaging expression values (avereps), resulting in a final 
matrix of 30,587 unique genes.

2.2. Statistical Modeling
Exploratory Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed a strong biological 
batch effect associated with the donors. Consequently, an additive linear model 
was adopted:

    Y ~ DoseNum + Donor

Where 'DoseNum' represents the continuous variable for radiation dose (0–8 Gy) 
and 'Donor' controls for basal inter-individual variability. Moderated 
t-statistics (eBayes) were used to generate a gene ranking based on the 
correlation with radiation dose. The resulting ranking exhibited a symmetric 
distribution (t-min = -9.36, t-max = +13.10), ideal for enrichment analyses.

2.3. Functional Analysis (GSEA)
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted using the multilevel algorithm 
via the 'fgsea' package, interrogating the Hallmark (broad biological processes) 
and KEGG (canonical pathways) collections, with specific focus on the 
KEGG_PARKINSONS_DISEASE pathway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Quality Control and Biological Validation
Initial analysis confirmed the technical quality of the data following 
annotation corrections. Biological validation of the experiment was achieved by 
analyzing Hallmark pathways, which served as "positive controls":

* DNA Damage Response: The HALLMARK_P53_PATHWAY was the most significantly 
  activated pathway (NES = +2.37, p_adj < 10^-11), confirming that cells 
  detected radiation-induced damage and activated repair/apoptosis mechanisms.
* Cell Cycle Arrest: Significant suppression of the G2M_CHECKPOINT pathway was 
  observed (NES = -1.90), indicating a halt in cell division to allow for 
  genomic repair.
* Inflammation: Strong induction of TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB (NES = +1.96) and 
  INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE (NES = +1.98) pathways.

3.2. General KEGG Pathway Alterations
Radiation induced profound changes in basic cellular machinery:
* Translation Suppression: Ribosome (NES = -2.82) and Translation initiation 
  (NES = -2.93) pathways were strongly repressed, consistent with energy 
  conservation in stressed cells.
* Lysosomal Activation: The Lysosome pathway (NES = +2.72) was upregulated, 
  suggesting increased autophagy or catabolic processes.

3.3. Evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Hypothesis
The specific test for the KEGG_PARKINSONS_DISEASE pathway did not demonstrate 
significant enrichment.
* Statistics: NES = 0.79, p-value = 0.91, p_adj = 0.96.
* Interpretation: The distribution of PD-associated genes within the radiation 
  response ranking was random (Brownian noise). Unlike DNA damage and 
  inflammatory pathways, genes associated with PD did not respond in a 
  coordinated manner to the radiation dose.

4. FIGURES AND LEGENDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 1: Distribution of Normalized Signal Intensities
Legend: Boxplot representing the density of normalized gene expression levels 
(Quantile Normalization). The alignment of medians and identical distributions 
across all 25 samples confirm the successful removal of technical biases, 
ensuring that subsequent variability is biological in origin.

Figure 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of Gene Expression Profiles
Legend: PCA plot showing PC1 vs. PC2. Samples cluster primarily by Donor 
(indicated by shapes), highlighting individual genetic variability as a major 
variance component. Within each donor cluster, a consistent vector gradient 
ordered by Dose (color scale: 0 to 8 Gy) is observed, validating the 
dose-dependent transcriptomic response and justifying the use of a paired 
statistical model.

Figure 3: GSEA Enrichment Plot for the KEGG Parkinson's Disease Pathway
Legend: Enrichment plot for the KEGG_PARKINSONS_DISEASE gene set. The flat 
running enrichment score (green line) and low Normalized Enrichment Score 
(NES = 0.79) indicate a random distribution of PD genes within the ranked list, 
confirming the absence of significant pathway activation or suppression in 
response to radiation.

5. DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis demonstrates that the OSD-157 dataset is technically robust for 
detecting biological responses to radiation, as evidenced by the clear p53 and 
inflammatory signatures. The bioinformatics pipeline, following annotation 
corrections, successfully recovered expected effects of radiological exposure.

However, regarding the neurodegenerative hypothesis, the data refute the 
existence of a radiation-induced "PD-like" signature in this experimental 
context. Three main factors explain this negative result:

1. Tissue Specificity: The analyzed samples are peripheral blood. The KEGG 
   Parkinson's pathway is enriched in genes specific to dopaminergic neurons 
   and synaptic components, whose basal expression in leukocytes is negligible.
2. Pathway Composition: The canonical pathway includes neuronal mitochondrial 
   complexes and genes such as PRKN, PINK1, and SNCA. The lack of regulation 
   of these genes suggests that radiation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in 
   blood (if present) operates via mechanisms distinct from those in PD pathology.
3. Nature of Stimulus: Although radiation causes oxidative stress—a component 
   of PD—the acute transcriptomic response (48h) prioritizes immediate survival 
   and DNA repair, differing from the chronic progressive degeneration of the 
   disease.

6. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is concluded that ionizing radiation induces a severe, dose-dependent 
transcriptomic response in blood cells, characterized by cell cycle arrest, 
p53 activation, and suppression of protein synthesis. However, there is no 
statistical evidence that radiation activates molecular mechanisms associated 
with Parkinson's Disease in this biological model.

The hypothesis of a direct molecular link between acute radiation and a 
Parkinson's signature is not supported by the leukocyte transcriptome. Future 
investigations into this topic must utilize neural models (e.g., iPSC-neurons, 
organoids, or glia) to overcome the tissue specificity limitations observed 
here.
