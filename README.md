Abstract

This study evaluated global gene expression changes in human peripheral blood samples exposed ex vivo to increasing doses of gamma radiation (0 to 8 Gy) following a 48-hour incubation period. Using the NASA GeneLab OSD-157 dataset, a robust bioinformatics pipeline was applied to perform normalization, linear modeling, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The results demonstrate a severe transcriptomic response characterized by the activation of the p53 signaling pathway and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the hypothesis that ionizing radiation induces molecular signatures associated with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) in leukocytes was specifically tested. No statistically significant enrichment was observed for the PD pathway (NES = 0.79, FDR = 0.95), suggesting an absence of molecular overlap in this acute experimental model.
