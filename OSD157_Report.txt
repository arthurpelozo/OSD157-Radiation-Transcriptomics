FINAL REPORT
Radiation Dose-Dependent Effects on Parkinson's Disease-Related Pathways 
with Focus on Mitophagy
================================================================================

1. OBJECTIVE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this study was to investigate whether ionizing radiation induces 
transcriptional effects associated with Parkinson's disease (PD)-related 
biological mechanisms, with particular emphasis on mitochondrial quality control 
and mitophagy. 

Given the lack of specificity and biological interpretability of broad pathway 
databases (e.g., KEGG PD), the analysis progressively converged toward 
biologically grounded, manually curated PD-relevant gene modules, culminating 
in a fine-grained dissection of the mitophagy pathway.

2. METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Data Processing and Pre-processing
Raw intensity files (.txt) from the Agilent platform were processed using the 
'limma' package in the R environment. During the initial import, annotation 
failures were detected in the native .adf files (a common issue with older 
array platforms). To resolve this, gene identifiers were extracted directly 
from the raw data objects (RG$genes), ensuring a 1:1 alignment between probe 
intensities and gene symbols.

Strict quality control filters were applied to remove technical control probes 
(e.g., "DarkCorner", "GE_BrightCorner") and probes lacking valid gene 
annotation.

- Background Correction: Performed using the 'normexp' method with an offset 
  of 50. This specific offset was chosen to damp down the variability of 
  low-intensity spots, preventing false positives among non-expressed genes.
- Normalization: Inter-array normalization was conducted using the Quantile 
  Normalization method, ensuring statistical comparability across all 25 samples 
  by forcing their empirical distributions to be identical.
- Probe Collapsing: Duplicate probes mapping to the same gene were collapsed 
  by averaging expression values (avereps). This step reduced the dimensionality 
  of the dataset to 30,587 unique genes, representing the unique transcriptional 
  output of the genome.

2.2. Statistical Modeling (Linear & Interaction Models)
Exploratory Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed a strong biological 
batch effect associated with the donors. To accurately isolate the radiation 
effect from this "donor noise," a paired additive linear model was adopted:

    Y ~ DoseNum + Donor

Where 'DoseNum' represents the continuous variable for radiation dose (0-8 Gy) 
and 'Donor' acts as a blocking factor. 

For the subsequent investigation of donor-specific responses, a full interaction 
model was also fitted:

    Y ~ DoseNum * Donor

Moderated t-statistics (eBayes) were used to generate a gene ranking based on 
the correlation with radiation dose. The resulting ranking exhibited a symmetric 
distribution (t-min = -9.36, t-max = +13.10), ideal for enrichment analyses.

2.3. Functional Analysis (GSEA & Custom Modules)
Standard Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted using the 'fgsea' 
multilevel algorithm. Initially, the analysis interrogated the Hallmark and 
KEGG collections.

Following the negative result for the broad KEGG PD pathway, the strategy 
shifted to Custom Module Analysis. We manually curated functionally distinct 
submodules based on literature:
- PD_mitophagy_core: PINK1, PARK7, FBXO7, ATP13A2
- PD_mitophagy_regulators: USP30, USP15 (Deubiquitinases)
- PD_mitophagy_autophagy_markers: SQSTM1 (p62), MAP1LC3B (LC3B)
- PD_dopaminergic_synapse: TH, SLC6A3, etc.

2.4. Pathway Activity Scoring (GSVA)
To assess the activation of these custom modules on a per-sample basis, Gene 
Set Variation Analysis (GSVA v2.4.1) was employed using Gaussian kernels. This 
generated a pathway-level expression matrix, which was then subjected to the 
same linear modeling pipeline as the gene-level data.

3. RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Quality Control and Biological Validation
Initial analysis confirmed the technical quality of the data. Biological 
validation was achieved by analyzing Hallmark pathways, which served as 
"positive controls":

- DNA Damage Response: The HALLMARK_P53_PATHWAY was the most significantly 
  activated pathway (NES = +2.37, p_adj < 10^-11), confirming that cells 
  detected radiation-induced damage.
- Cell Cycle Arrest: Significant suppression of the G2M_CHECKPOINT pathway 
  (NES = -1.90), indicating a halt in division to repair genomic damage.
- Inflammation: Strong induction of TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB (NES = +1.96).

3.2. General KEGG Pathway Alterations
Radiation induced profound changes in basic cellular machinery:
- Translation Suppression: Ribosome and Translation initiation pathways were 
  strongly repressed (NES < -2.8), consistent with energy conservation in 
  stressed cells.
- Lysosomal Activation: The Lysosome pathway was upregulated (NES = +2.72), 
  suggesting increased catabolic activity.

3.3. Evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Hypothesis (Broad vs. Specific)
The specific test for the generic KEGG_PARKINSONS_DISEASE pathway did not 
demonstrate significant enrichment (NES = 0.79, p_adj = 0.96). This indicates 
that the broad "PD signature" (which includes neuronal-specific synaptic genes) 
is not activated in blood.

However, the Custom Mitophagy Analysis revealed a targeted response. Upon 
dissecting the pathway into functional units, a clear "Push-Pull" mechanism 
emerged regarding mitochondrial quality control:

1. Activation of Execution Machinery (+):
   - Autophagy markers were strongly upregulated (logFC +0.066, adj.p = 0.0013), 
     confirming the upregulation of SQSTM1 and LC3B.
   - Core PINK1/PARK7 sensors showed moderate activation (logFC +0.033, 
     adj.p = 0.024).

2. Release of Negative Regulators (-):
   - Mitophagy Regulators (Deubiquitinases USP30 and USP15) were significantly 
     repressed (logFC -0.082, adj.p = 0.002).

3.4. Donor Specificity
The interaction model (DoseNum * Donor) revealed that this mitophagy response 
is largely conserved across donors. While some variability exists in the 
magnitude of the response (FDR ~ 0.08 for regulators), the direction of the 
effect—specifically the downregulation of "brakes" like USP30—was consistent, 
indicating a fundamental biological response rather than an idiosyncratic one.

4. DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis demonstrates that the OSD-157 dataset is technically robust. 
While the data refute the existence of a broad "PD-like" transcriptomic 
signature (likely due to tissue specificity and the lack of dopaminergic 
neurons in blood), it uncovers a highly specific, dose-dependent engagement of 
mitochondrial quality control.

The crucial finding is the coordinated downregulation of deubiquitinases 
(USP30/15) concurrent with the upregulation of PINK1/Parkin. Biologically, 
USP30 opposes Parkin by removing ubiquitin tags from mitochondria. By 
suppressing these "erasers," the radiation-exposed cells effectively lower the 
threshold for triggering mitophagy, ensuring efficient clearance of damaged 
organelles.

This profile suggests that while the cells are not undergoing neurodegeneration, 
they are mounting a sophisticated, stress-adaptive mitophagy response.

5. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is concluded that ionizing radiation induces a severe, dose-dependent 
transcriptomic response in blood cells. While there is no evidence of a broad 
Parkinson's Disease molecular signature, the analysis identified a robust 
mitophagy-specific program.

The hypothesis of a direct molecular link between acute radiation and PD is 
refined: radiation does not mimic the disease state, but it actively modulates 
the exact mitochondrial maintenance machinery (PINK1/Parkin/USP30) whose failure 
is implicated in the disease. Future investigations should utilize neural models 
to determine if this same mechanism leads to synaptic loss in a neuronal context.
