1. OBJECTIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this study was to investigate whether ionizing radiation induces 
transcriptional effects associated with Parkinson's disease (PD)-related 
biological mechanisms, with particular emphasis on mitochondrial quality control 
and mitophagy. 

Given the lack of specificity of broad pathway databases (e.g., KEGG PD), the 
analysis progressed from broad screening toward biologically grounded, manually 
curated PD-relevant gene modules. This culminated in a fine-grained dissection 
of the mitophagy pathway and a rigorous statistical test of its relationship 
with systemic molecular vulnerability.

2. METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Data Processing and Pre-processing
Raw intensity files (.txt) from the Agilent platform were processed using the 
'limma' package in the R environment. Gene identifiers were extracted directly 
from the raw data objects (RG$genes) to ensure accurate annotation.

Strict quality control filters were applied:
- Background Correction: Performed using the 'normexp' method (offset 50).
- Normalization: Quantile method to ensure comparability across 25 samples.
- Log2 Transformation: CRITICAL STEP. Raw intensities were Log2-transformed 
  prior to analysis to stabilize variance and meet linear modeling assumptions.
- Probe Collapsing: Duplicate probes were averaged (avereps), resulting in 
  30,587 unique genes.

2.2. Statistical Modeling (Linear & Interaction Models)
A paired additive linear model was adopted (Y ~ DoseNum + Donor) to isolate the 
radiation effect from donor heterogeneity. Moderated t-statistics (eBayes) were 
used to generate the gene ranking.

2.3. Functional Analysis Strategy (The "Funnel" Approach)
Step 1: Global Screening (Standard GSEA)
Interrogation of Hallmark and KEGG collections to validate general radiation 
responses (p53, Inflammation) and identifying key mechanisms (Lysosome).

Step 2: Targeted PD Module Screening (Broad Modules)
Testing three manually curated PD-relevant modules:
   a. PD_mito_complexI (Respiratory chain)
   b. PD_dopaminergic_synapse (Dopamine metabolism)
   c. PD_mitophagy_PINK1_PRKN (Mitophagy markers)

Step 3: Fine-Grained Mitophagy Decomposition ("Push-Pull")
Structural decomposition of the mitophagy pathway into functional units:
   - Core Sensors (PINK1, PARK7...)
   - Regulators (USP30, USP15)
   - Execution Markers (SQSTM1, MAP1LC3B)

2.4. Pathway Activity Scoring (GSVA)
Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) with Gaussian kernels was used to calculate 
per-sample enrichment scores.

2.5. Molecular Risk Modeling (Mediation vs. Parallelism)
To test the relationship between Mitophagy and PD Risk:
1. "Clean" PD Risk Score: Calculated using 15 non-mitophagy vulnerability genes 
   (e.g., LRRK2, GBA, VDAC1), excluding overlaps.
2. Modeling:
   - Model A: Radiation -> Clean PD Risk
   - Model C: Radiation + Mitophagy -> Clean PD Risk (to test independence).

3. RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Quality Control and Biological Validation (Step 1)
The Log2-corrected data showed robust biological validation:
- DNA Damage Response: HALLMARK_P53_PATHWAY strongly activated (NES = +2.42, 
  p < 10^-12).
- Inflammation: TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB strongly induced (NES = +2.04, 
  p < 10^-7).
- Lysosomal Activation: A massive induction of the KEGG_LYSOSOME pathway was 
  detected (NES = +2.82, p < 10^-17), supporting the clearance hypothesis.

3.2. Evaluation of Targeted PD Modules (Step 2 - Screening)
Screening of broad modules confirmed specificity:
- PD_mito_complexI: No significant enrichment (logFC = -0.016, p = 0.24).
- PD_dopaminergic_synapse: No significant enrichment (logFC = +0.018, p = 0.27).
- PD_mitophagy_PINK1_PRKN: Showed highly significant activation (logFC = +0.059, p = 0.00019).

Using GSEA to screen specific pathway enrichment (NES), we confirmed high 
specificity of the radiation response:
- PD_mito_complexI: No significant enrichment (NES = -0.94, p = 0.55).
- PD_dopaminergic_synapse: No significant enrichment (NES = +0.92, p = 0.56).
- PD_mitophagy_PINK1_PRKN: Showed significant activation (NES = +1.72, p = 0.019).

The response is specific to mitochondrial quality control, with no 
evidence of acute neurodegeneration or general bioenergetic failure.

3.3. Fine-Grained Mitophagy Analysis (Step 3 - "Push-Pull" Mechanism)
Dissection of the pathway confirmed a coordinated "Push-Pull" mechanism:
1. Activation (+): Autophagy markers (SQSTM1, LC3B) were significantly upregulated 
   (logFC = +0.064, p = 0.0001).
2. Disinhibition (-): Negative Regulators (USP30/USP15) were significantly 
   repressed (logFC = -0.086, p = 0.0001).

3.4. Mechanistic Analysis of PD Molecular Risk (The "Dual Signature")
To understand systemic relevance, the "Clean PD Risk Score" was analyzed:

1. Total Effect (Radiation -> Risk): 
   Linear modeling confirmed that radiation dose significantly drives the 
   expression of PD risk genes (Coefficient = +0.012, p = 0.0013). 
   *Note: Coefficient reflects Log2 scale; effect is robust and linear.*

2. Dual Signature Proof (Model C): 
   When controlling for Mitophagy activity in the combined model:
   - The direct effect of radiation remained significant (p = 0.013).
   - The Mitophagy term became non-significant (p = 0.30) in predicting risk 
     variance within the same dose groups.

   Conclusion: Unlike simple mediation, this indicates a "Dual Signature." 
   Radiation independently forces a metabolic cleanup cost (Mitophagy) AND 
   activates transcriptomic vulnerability (Risk Genes) in parallel.

4. DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1. Specificity of the Response 
The analysis rules out generic damage. The lack of significance for Complex I 
and Synapses (p > 0.20) confirms that the cells are not undergoing acute 
metabolic collapse. The response is a specific adaptation of the quality 
control machinery.

4.2. The "Push-Pull" Mechanism
The corrected data reinforces the "Push-Pull" logic. Radiation increases 
damage sensors (logFC +0.033) and concurrently suppresses the "brake" USP30 
(logFC -0.086). This transcriptional repression of deubiquitinases lowers the 
threshold for mitophagy, optimizing the system for rapid clearance of 
radiation-damaged organelles.

4.3. Dual Vulnerability Signature
The persistent significance of the radiation term in the full model (p = 0.013) 
supports a "Parallel Hit" model rather than simple mediation. 

Radiation acts as a systemic stressor that branches into two simultaneous 
consequences:
1. The Metabolic Response: Activation of the mitophagy/lysosomal machinery to 
   clear physical damage.
2. The Transcriptomic Scar: Direct upregulation of susceptibility genes (LRRK2, 
   VDAC), independent of the cleaning process.

This "Dual Signature" implies that the cellular state is fragile on two fronts: 
high metabolic demand for cleaning and high expression of genetic risk factors.

5. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ionizing radiation induces a specific state of "Dual Transcriptomic Vulnerability." 
It forces cells to engage a robust "Push-Pull" mitophagy mechanism (validated by 
USP30 repression and Lysosomal induction) while simultaneously and independently 
upregulating a core set of Parkinson's disease risk genes. This suggests that 
radiation exposure creates a latent molecular fragility that extends beyond 
simple mitochondrial damage.
